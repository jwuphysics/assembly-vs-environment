# Assembly versus Environment
Is halo assembly history or environment more important for learning galaxy properties? 

## Data

**Environment** We are using `FoF_subfind` subhalo catalogs from Illustris TNG100, crossmatched between dark matter only and hydrodynamic simulations. We select halos with $M_{\rm halo} \geq 10^{10} M_{\odot}$ and without any subhalo flags.

**Assembly history** We are using the `Subfind` merger trees from TNG100-1-Dark, and selecting only halos with $M_{\rm halo} \geq 10^[10} M_{\odot}$.
